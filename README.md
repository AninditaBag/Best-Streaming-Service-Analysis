# Best-Streaming-Service-Analysis
For analysing which is the best streaming service, I will be using the ratings of shows on all the major platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. There is a lot of competition between all of the above streaming services . It has been a very amazing task for me to find which is the best streaming service among them.
Data At Hand:
The dataset that I will use for the task of Best Streaming service analysis contains a comprehensive list of all the TV shows which are available on the 4 platforms that we are comparing in this task. The dataset contains:
1. Name of the TV Show
2. The year in which the TV Show was produced
3. Target age group
4. IMDB Rating
5. Rotten Tomatoes percentage score
6. 1 or 0 feature indicating whether the TV Show is available on a particular Streaming service.
